# odin-recipes
recipe project
I am working on the recipe-project for odin. This will help me put my basic HTML skills picked up so far in the course into action.
I'm excited but also a noob. I will choose some fun recipes I can look back at later and make them, then smile upon this day.
If I'm not willing to look like a foolish beginner, I'll never be a graceful master. Embarrassment is the cost of entry
