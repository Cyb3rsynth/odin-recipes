    <h2>Why Cook This Recipe?!</h2>

        <p>My all-time favorite pasta recipe, is the Bolognese sauce! Slow-simmered to perfection, with a rich tomato base with mouth-watering meat and veggies
            with the coziest blends of seasoning and loaded with garlic. Serve with fresh pasta, gnocchi, or roasted eggplant for something lower-carb!</p>
        
        <p>My Nonna used to make this for dinner and I will always remember how satisfied I was at the end of the meal. Elevate your life with
            this bolognese recipe, and don't forget to sprinkle <strong>extra parmesan</strong> before serving. Hope you enjoy!</p>
